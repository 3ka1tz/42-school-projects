### Disclaimer

These repositories contain my personal solutions to 42 School projects. Each one is written in my own style, with clean, well-commented code to make it easier to follow and understand.

The goal is to help others learn, reflect, and improve â€” not to encourage blind copying. Please take the time to understand the concepts, write your own code, and treat these solutions as a reference, not a shortcut.
